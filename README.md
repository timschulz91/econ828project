# Econ 828 Term Project

This is my term project for my term project in Experimental Economics. I am proposing an experiment in which two poor players can try to coordinate on a revolution against a rich player. Each poor person decides whether to attempt a revolution based on their beliefs about the other poor players decision. This belief is formed based on perceived inequality between the poor and rich players (a table of possible payoffs is shown to all players).

Additionally, rich players have the option of purchasing insurance against revolution attempts. This decision is also based on beliefs about perceived inequality: If the rich player thinks the inequality in payoffs shown is too great, he may choose to purchase insurance because he believes a revolution to be likely.

The goal is to measure people's perception about how unequal the distribution of possible payoffs is depending on their own role (rich or poor).
